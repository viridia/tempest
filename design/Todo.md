# TODOs

* Infix operators
* Constant infix operators
* Unary operators
* Member access operator
* I think we might need another pass after nameresolution:
  * lower infix operators
  * fold constants
* isNarrower, equal, assignable have lots of unimplemented cases. Need tests.
  * inferred source types
  * structural typing in unification
  * structural typing for field definitions
  * narrower doesn't handle type vars (except inferred)
* If / While / For
* Match
* Traits
* Type inference for constructor calls
* Unify structural typing
* Unify function types
* Constructor calls
* Expression callables
* Private / Protected visibility tests
* Class method overload tests
* Support for 'self' and 'super'
* Type parameter defaults
* Get rid of classes we don't need
* More statement types
* Extend unification to not need isAssignable
* Intrinsic functions
* Methods returning 'self'
* Self as a template parameter.
* Downcasting
* Destructured assignment (arrays)
* Destructured assignment (objects)
* Pre/post increment/decrement
* throw
* Immutability
* Range expressions
* Anonymous functions
* Closures
* Array literals
* Set literals
